## Titanic Spaceship Competition on Kaggle
Welcome to my repository dedicated to the Titanic Spaceship Competition on Kaggle! This project aims to showcase my approach to solving the competition's challenge, applying various machine learning techniques, and optimizing models for the best possible performance.

Both python notebooks have been used for trying a final prediction. The best model I made got me a leadearboard position of 502/2403, which I hold today. I'm currently studying feature engineering so I can improve this resuls.

## About the Competition
The Titanic Spaceship Competition is a popular Kaggle competition where participants are tasked with predicting the survival of passengers aboard a spaceship. The challenge involves understanding and analyzing the dataset, engineering features, and building predictive models.

## Project Structure
### Data Exploration:
Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Visualization of data distributions, missing values, and relationships between features.

### Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature engineering to create new features that may improve model performance.

### Model Building:
Implementation of various machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.
Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search.

### Model Evaluation:
Assessment of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Comparison of different models to identify the best-performing one.

### Final Submission:
Preparation of the final model and generation of predictions for submission to the competition.
Documentation of the final approach and results.

### Datasets
The competition provides a training dataset and a test dataset. The training dataset is used to build and validate models, while the test dataset is used to generate predictions for the competition.

### Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
